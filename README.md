# JSON Forms - More Forms. Less Code

### Complex Forms in the blink of an eye

[JSON Forms](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms) eliminates the tedious task of writing fully-featured forms by hand by leveraging the capabilities of JSON, JSON Schema and Javascript.

## Ionic Package (Angular)

This is the JSONForms Angular Ionic renderers package which provides the necessary bindings for Ionic 3.

It uses [JSON Forms Core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/core) and [JSON Forms Angular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsonforms/angular) bindings.

This package showcases the development of an angular-ionic-based renderer set for JSON Forms. It was actively maintained with JSON Forms up until [version `2.3.2`](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/tree/0cf18d3df877c5240188b0ae4e0d18e3638fc026).
